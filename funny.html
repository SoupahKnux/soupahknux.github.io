        This might come off as edgy to you, but I've been wanting to let this out for a while now.<br><br>

        I wasn't much from the very start. I didn't have any cool achievements nor was I just interesting in general.
        I don't think much changed as of today, but oh well. I was one of the most notorious guys in the kindergarten.
        I beat everyone up and was generally punished a lot. I had pretty much no friends in there and that made me sad. I had no one
        to share that fun with. Somehow, I pulled through.<br><br>
        I went into elementary school pretty much with no real relationships with anyone. I thought this could be the chance to
        change myself.<br>

        <h2>Boy, was I wrong.</h2><br>

        I found myself again, beating people up with no remorse. I gave one guy a concussion once and broke another guy's glasses.
        I wasn't filled with regret for my past actions, I thought I was doing what's right. In my eyes. But somehow, I pulled through.
        <br><br>

        Most of my middle school went... alright. I was still having my own troubles and even then I somehow managed to give everyone
        else trouble. I made some friends, or, well, so I used to think.<br><br>

        I was, pardon my French, fucked in the head. All my intrusive thoughts would come to me and give me headache. I didn't want
        to do what I was told. Even if it was by me. And then, all of a sudden, I realized.

        I felt nothing. All that pain I was going through was suddenly gone. All I had was a mask of the happy ol' me you probably
        already know, if you're reading this. And if you're reading this - you most likely know what i've been going through
        recently. Searching for my true self. Thinking about what would happen if I was never born or for some reason disappeared.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I was tempted to try that out. And I did. For the past like, 4 months, I've been burning everything I had - relationships,
        links, memories of myself just to feel something. And I did. Agony. Pain. It was addicting. I wanted more.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I couldn't stop myself. I kept burning and burning, with no intention to put myself out. I knew that one day all this
        would bring me to a state from which I can never return. And I still know. Except now it's too late.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Some of you would know my favourite song was I Am Electric by Heaven's Basement. There was this line in it:<br>
        
        <h3>"Watch me burn, 'til the future is no more"</h3>

        <br>
        Now I realise. It wasn't just an edgy line from a song I liked. It was a prophecy. It was my fate. To burn myself. To rid
        myself of any chance of having a future.<br>
        <br>
        And now with my relationships nearly lost, that addicting pain turned into the torment I live in now. I am not needed for this world
        to bloom and shine. Everything would be the same without me, hell, it might be better.<br>
        <br>
        But I am here. And it hurts. It burns. Please put me out. No, don't do it. End me fast. Send me to hell. Rip my heart out and 
        crush it. Anything to leave this torment. Please save me. Save me. Save me. Save me. Save me. Save me. Save me. Save me. Save me.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I am sorry.
