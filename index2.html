          Hello! Welcome to my (very unfinished) website!<br><br><br><br><br>

          I am Super Knuckles, Knux, Шарнир, SuperKnux13, whatever you call me. I am just a Russian guy on the internet, at the age of 17, that does stuff on my YouTube channel from time to time. I play games a lot, and most likely suck at them nonetheless. This website serves as my personal place where you can find info about me that I'm willing to share, news about my projects, and other stuffs.<br><br>

          I also accidentally wreak havoc and cause destruction. Don't ask about the router. <i>Any</i> router.
